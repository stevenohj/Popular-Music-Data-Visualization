# Popular-Music-Data-Visualization
This simple data visualization app will show you what the music scene was like for a specific date in the past or today. A bubble visualization will be generated with each bubble representing a musical artist who had a song in Spotify's top 200 streamed songs on the given date. The size of each artist's bubble depends on how many streams their songs in the top 200 had, so the more top 200 streams an artist had, the larger their bubble.
